# API-Detector
## Introduction
API Detector is a small Android-app that can show your device's API level.

## Quick Start
**You can find <API Detector.apk> at the folder menu to download easily, ignore possible warnings when installing.** </br>
When you launch this app, you can see this page first:

And **when you click the button, your device API level will be shown on the screen. My device (HONOR 20) is API 29.**

## Features
The color of API level Shown on screen will be decided by the level:
- GREEN API >= 26
- YELLOW API < 26 and API >= 16
- RED API < 16 (and I recommend you'd better buy a new Android device if possible)

## Why
Why I should know my device's API level?
It may be helpful for those Android developers, for common users, it can also help you to decide if you should buy a new device!
Seems useless, but its utility depends on you.

## NOTICE
Subsequent updates will continue. I will build it into a simple device detection app, and make the user interface more friendly.
